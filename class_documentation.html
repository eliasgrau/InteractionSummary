<blockquote>I have been working a lot and its beginning to be fun. I am leraning and getting much more confortable with coding/ making websites. I didn't think I would actually like coding but now that I see the posibilities it is actually cool. A website is like an interactive white piece of paper with which you can play. And the best part of it, you can cruble it and easily throw it somewhere.!! peace.
