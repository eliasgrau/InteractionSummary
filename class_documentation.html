<blockquote>I have been working a lot and its beginning to be fun. I am leraning and getting much more confortable with coding/ making websites. I didn't think I would actually like coding but now that I see the posibilities it is actually cool. A website is like an interactive white piece of paper with which you can play. And the best part of it, you can cruble it and easily throw it somewhere.!! peace.

I understood more about JavaScript. Javascript is basically a function. You put something in a get something out. My biggest struggles are to understand how to write things down. It probably is a question of time and repetition until i better understand what i am doing. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<mark>'document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "text"' </mark>  means that the content of the id "demo" is being changed to "text". .getElementById means that we that the element which is called ("") and transform it.

<br>
<br>
<br>
What does <mark> document. </mark> stand for as well as <mark>.innerHTML </mark> ?

<br>
<br>
Ok I understand a bit more. .innerHTML means that the change is happening to the html text. If it would say .scr instead, we could change the text to an image.
