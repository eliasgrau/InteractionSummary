<h1> My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? </h1>
<p>The text “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” by Laura Schwulst was inspiring in the sense that it gave me a different perspective on website. The topic of the web and thereby the websites we create oftentimes seam slightly abstract. The text helped me better relate by giving me analogies of website. Reading the text, I was questioning how strongly and literally we can draw an analogy to the real/physical world, when building websites.

<h1> Fuck Content </h1>
<p>The text “Fuck Content” is very interesting. It addresses a debate I started to have with my family a some time ago. The question of why we are creating things and whether it is ok to make thing for the form alone. A question that I am always asking myself in this concern, is whether there is a difference between art and design. While art lives by bringing content into a form, Design might be able to live with the form itself. I did not yet answer this question to myself but I believe it is a question we should ask ourselves frequently. How much content do I need for my work to be meaningful and how much meaning does the form create itself? </p>

<h1> Metaphors We Live By </h1>
<h3>date: 02/10</h3>
<p>George Lakoff's and Mark Johnson’s text “Metaphors We Live By” analyses how we use metaphors in everyday life and how they help us to communicate our messages. Thereby, the text mainly looks at indirect metaphors rather than direct comparisons. According to one of the Authors examples, we use the depiction of war to describe a discussion or an argumentation. Thereby, the system after which we would use metaphors would become clearer. Following, the authors elucidate Orientational metaphors according to which we would give certain conditions an orientation such a up or down, (high and low). This realisation then brings them to the conclusion of us valuing certain conditions over others and that our desires for a two sided condition could only be realistic if these two conditions we desire would not contradict each other in our valuation. 
<br><br>

In my opinion, the text is very interesting however it makes a lot of assumptions that I started question while reading. Is (for example) “winning an argument” really a metaphor of war? Is it the same “Up” we mean when we speak of the future as the “up” we mean when speaking of “better” or the definition of someone’s status? Is a high status in fact always better or can it also be used to neutrally describe someone else’s condition (e.g. social network)? If these questions remain, can we question the conclusion? </p>

<h1> Junkspace </h1>
<h3>date: 02/10</h3>
<p>The text “Junkspace” by Rem Koolhaas is very interesting though harder to understand in the first reading. Due to the fact that Koolhaas defines Junkspace in a rather abstract way, I remain uncertain about what he in fact means by Junkspace in. Furthermore, I remain uncertain of whether and how strongly the text criticises the existence of Junkspace. This for sure makes the text interesting and poetically critical. The author primarily talks about the effects of Junkspace while keeping it abstract enough for the reading to question whether Koolhaas refers to a physical space, or whether a social phenomenon is being addressed. All in all, Rem Koolhaas’s viewpoint is certainly very interesting and stimulating a critical debate with the world that surrounds us. Nevertheless, I wish I had an easier time to understand the context and background of his words, leaving me with a clearer viewpoint.
