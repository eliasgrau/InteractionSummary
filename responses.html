<h1> My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? </h1>
<p>The text “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” by Laura Schwulst was inspiring in the sense that it gave me a different perspective on website. The topic of the web and thereby the websites we create oftentimes seam slightly abstract. The text helped me better relate by giving me analogies of website. Reading the text, I was questioning how strongly and literally we can draw an analogy to the real/physical world, when building websites.

<h1> Fuck Content </h1>
<p>The text “Fuck Content” is very interesting. It addresses a debate I started to have with my family a some time ago. The question of why we are creating things and whether it is ok to make thing for the form alone. A question that I am always asking myself in this concern, is whether there is a difference between art and design. While art lives by bringing content into a form, Design might be able to live with the form itself. I did not yet answer this question to myself but I believe it is a question we should ask ourselves frequently. How much content do I need for my work to be meaningful and how much meaning does the form create itself? </p>
