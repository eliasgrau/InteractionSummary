<p>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<h6>now we're talking </h6>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<strong> 1. </strong>  <h3>Cut ¾ of the peeled beetroot into small dice <br>
(you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) <br>
and set the rest aside. Melt the butter in a large pan, <br>
and then soften the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes. </h3>
<br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h6> let's move on </h6>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>	
<strong> 2. </strong>  <h3> Add the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot,<br>
 allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter. <br>
 Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if <br>
 the vegetables begin to look dry. Meanwhile, grate the <br>
 remaining beetroot. </h3>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h6> making progress</h6>


<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<strong> 3. </strong> <h3> Pour in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and <br>
simmer for 15 minutes, then add the cabbage, garlic and <br>
grated beetroot. Cook until all the vegetables are tender <br>
(about 10 minutes). </h3>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h6>get ready, wash your spoons</h6>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br>
<strong> 4. </strong> <h3> Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and <br>
taste. Add a little more of any of these if necessary, then <br>
serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, and some <br>
Polish bread on the side. </h3>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h6>ready, set goooo!</h6>

<BLOCKQUOTE> <em> <h3>Is barszcz the best thing ever to come out of a beetroot, or a <br>
waste of a pair of Marigolds? Does it need meat, or are simple <br>
vegetarian versions truer to the spirit of the dish? And <br>
(deep breath) which country makes the best? </h3>
