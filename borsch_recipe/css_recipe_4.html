<h1 class="HYDI"> HOW YOU DO IT:</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p class="step1">
<strong> 1. </strong>  Cut ¾ of the peeled beetroot into small dice <br>
(you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) <br>
and set the rest aside. Melt the butter in a large pan, <br>
and then soften the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.
<br><br>
<br>	
</p>

<p class="step2">
<strong> 2. </strong>  Add the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot,<br>
 allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter. <br>
 Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if <br>
 the vegetables begin to look dry. Meanwhile, grate the <br>
 remaining beetroot.
<br><br>
<br>
</p>


<p class="step3">
<strong> 3. </strong> Pour in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and <br>
simmer for 15 minutes, then add the cabbage, garlic and <br>
grated beetroot. Cook until all the vegetables are tender <br>
(about 10 minutes).
<br><br><br>
</p>

<p class="step4">
<strong> 4. </strong> Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and <br>
taste. Add a little more of any of these if necessary, then <br>
serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, and some <br>
Polish bread on the side.
