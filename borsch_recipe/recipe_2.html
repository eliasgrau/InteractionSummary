The other option, of course,is to fake it. 			<br>
Catherine Atkinson suggests in her <strong> survey of Polish and Russian cooking, </strong>			<br>
From Borsch to Blinis, that a respectable alternative can be made by 

			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>


			<em>
bringing a pan of grated beetroot, stock and lemon juice to the boil, allowing it	<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br> to sit for half an hour, and then straining. </em>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

The resulting liquid has a less complex flavour than the real thing, but does the job of adding tang to Catherine's soup, 	<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>and at considerably less cost to one's airing cupboard.
