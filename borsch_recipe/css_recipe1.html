<h1>Plantbased Borscht recipe</h1>


<p> Borscht is a <strong> <em>traditional soup </em> </strong>hailing from Russia and Eastern Europe. It wouldn’t be borscht without beetsand some kind of souring ingredient such as wine vinegar or lemon juice. It almost always has shredded cabbage too.   </p>


<p>  Beyond that, ingredients can vary widely with the addition of beans among many other ingredients. I include carrots and potatoes and use vegetable stock. </p>

<p>  STEP 1: Prepare the beets!! </p>

<p>  i. Cut off the beet tops and discard (or save to make sauteed beet greens) <br>
ii. Peel beets using a vegetable peeler. <br>
iii.Cut into 1″ cubes. </p>



<h6>  sindenote: wear gloves when preparing beets so people don't think you killed someone  </h6>


<br><br><br><br>
<p>  STEP 2: Sauté the beets and other vegetables in oil </p>


<p>  STEP 3: Add the vegetable broth and simmer<font> </p>


<p>  STEP 4: Stir in lemon juice and zest and serve hot </p>
