<h1> NO kvas

		Lesley Chamberlain gives a <strong> "modern Polish" </strong>recipe from Lwów,
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



		<em>"attributed to what is now western Russia" </em>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>	
		<blockquote> ...she loses me when she qualifies this by adding "in fact, therefore, it is Ukrainian" <br>
			(apparently the city, now Lviv, became part of the Ukraine in <b>1944</b>) </blockquote>

		Confusing as this may be, what's interesting is that, instead of the sour beetroot, she uses a mixture of sour cream and flour, added at the end of cooking time to thicken the soup. <br><br><br>
		<br><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		I'm not keen on the raw flour flavour, and the creaminess of the finished soup is at odds with my idea of borsch, <br><br><br>however authentic it might be if you happen to find yourself in <em> Lwów / Lviv / Russia.</em>
